# SharpScript
A really dumb proof of concept for scripting for a game project that fell through.


# Theory
The whole idea was to add a simple scripting system for in game actions (e.g. special abilities).
As such, it had two "real" goals in mind:
Where and What

Also too make this less painful everything (including expressions) is spaced out and I don't follow MDAS (lol!)
